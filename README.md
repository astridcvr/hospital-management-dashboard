# Hospital Management Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project analyzes a fictional hospital dataset to uncover patterns in patient demographics, appointment behavior, and billing performance. It combines Python-based exploratory data analysis (EDA) with Power BI dashboarding to demonstrate how healthcare institutions can use data to support operational decisions.

## Tools Used
- **Python**: Pandas, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook
- **Power BI**: Data modeling, KPIs, interactive dashboard
- **Power Query & DAX**: Data transformation and calculations
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control and project documentation 

## Dataset Description
The dataset simulates hospital operations over a year and includes:
- Appointment scheduling
- Patient demographics
- Visit reasons
- Billing amounts
- Treatment types

### Size:
- 200 appointments
- 50 unique patients
- 2023 timeframe

## Key Insights
- The busiest days are Tuesdays and Wednesdays.
- No-show and cancellation rates are each 26%.
- Chemotherapy and MRI are the most expensive treatment types.
- Female patients tend to be older than male patients on average.
- April 2023 had the highest total billing.
